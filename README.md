# tsimulus-exporter

A Node-js client exporting timeseries from [tsimulus-ms](https://github.com/cetic/tsimulus-ms) into [influxdb](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb).

# Description

This Node-js client stores the data generated by the [Realistic Time Series Generator Microservice](tsimulus-ms) sent by the vuejs app [tsimulus-gui](https://github.com/cetic/tsimulus-gui) into an influxdb. 
The data stored in the influxdb will be used as data provider for the Grafana part of the vuejs app [tsimulus-gui](https://github.com/cetic/tsimulus-gui).

# How to use it?

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/cetic/tsimulus-exporter.git
```

Get started by installing and importing everything we need! We assume you're running Node 6. (You can download nodejs [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

```
npm install
```

Before running it, we need that the influxdb is available. An image Docker is available [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb/).

2. Run it.

Go ahead and boot your app using 

```
node app.js
```

and try it out!
